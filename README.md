# Connect Four

This is the coursework I submited for my third year 'Algorithms and Data Structures' module - I received a grade (with merit) of 80.8%

We were asked to build a simple, command-line only version of the classic game “Connect Four” using a programming language of our choice, with the goal of adopting appropriate data structures and algorithms.

I chose C# because it's my fav <3

The minimum requirement was a Connect Four game playable by two players. To earn a better grade (60%+), there were some additional, optional requirements, all of which I implemented:

* The game should record the history of play and allow earlier games to be automatically re-played from this record, i.e. the sequence of moves that the players make during a game
* The game should support undo, i.e. once a move is made you should be able to un-apply it, returning the game state to the immediate previous state. Your players should be able to undo moves right back to the initial game state
* The game  support redo of moves that have been un-done

For additional marks (80%+), we were encouraged to go beyond scope and be creative. For this, I implemented an AI player and the option to customise the size of the board.
